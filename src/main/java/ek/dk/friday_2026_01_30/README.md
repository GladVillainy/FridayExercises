## Task List Application (School Assignment)

This project was developed as part of a school assignment.

The purpose of the assignment is to practice core Java concepts such as:

* Generics with type bounds
* Implementing the `Iterable` interface
* Using lambda expressions and streams
* Working with dates using the Java Time API

The application demonstrates how tasks can be created, filtered, sorted by date, and evaluated based on deadlines in a structured and type-safe way.
